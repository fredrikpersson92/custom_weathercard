<h1>Custom Weather Card</h1>

This creates a custom-button-card showing the current temperature, min temp, high temp and wind speed of the day. The background changes based on the entity state. Control the background images by replacing the variables.

<h3> Weather sensor </h3>
You will need a sensor that collects the relevant data. For this I suggest installing the Accuweather integration, and from there creating a new custom sensor. Just copy the code provided into your config.

<h3> Location </h3>
Update the "city" and "area" variables to your own location.
